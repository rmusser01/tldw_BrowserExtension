## 2. Keyboard Shortcuts üöÄ

### Status: IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ
### Priority: HIGH

#### Description
Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions to improve user efficiency.

#### Implemented Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter**: Send chat message from anywhere
- **Ctrl+1/2/3/4 / Cmd+1/2/3/4**: Switch between tabs (Chat, Prompts, Characters, Media)
- **Escape**: Close modals, clear search, cancel operations
- **Ctrl+/ or Cmd+/**: Focus search input in current tab

#### Implementation Details
1. Added `setupKeyboardShortcuts()` function (lines 984-1031)
2. Added `handleEscapeKey()` function (lines 1036-1082)

4. Detects Mac vs PC for proper modifier keys
5. Prevents default browser behavior
6. Shows toast notifications for user feedback

#### Technical Decisions
- Used single global keydown listener for efficiency
- Mac detection for Cmd vs Ctrl key
- Escape key has smart context awareness (modals first, then search)
- Changed chat input to allow Enter for new lines, Ctrl+Enter to send

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ smart-context.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ batch-processor.js

## Issues Encountered

### 1. SmartContextDetector Not Used
- **Issue**: Class was fully implemented but never instantiated or used
- **Solution**: Created instance and connected to tab detection logic

### 2. Event Listeners Memory Leak
- **Issue**: Complex event listener tracking system might cause memory leaks
- **Solution**: Simplified approach with proper cleanup on popup close

### 3. Large File Size
- **Issue**: popup.js is too large and difficult to maintain
- **Solution**: Plan to split into modules in future iteration

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Smart Context Detection works for all URL patterns
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work across all tabs
- [ ] Process All Tabs handles errors gracefully
- [ ] Loading states appear for all async operations
- [ ] Dark mode persists across sessions

## Future Enhancements

2. **Conversation History**: View and search past chats
3. **Export Options**: Export chats as markdown
4. **Custom Shortcuts**: User-definable keyboard shortcuts
5. **Advanced Context**: Analyze page content, not just URLs
